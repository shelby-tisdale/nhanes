This repository includes all code for a brief project in which propensity score matching was utilized to determine the causal impact of high physical activity on mortality. All data is from the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html), "a large, ongoing, cross-sectional study of the non-institutionalized US population conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in two-year waves using a multi-stage stratified sampling scheme." Data is publicly available for download [here](https://functionaldataanalysis.org/dataset_nhanes.html).

This project was completed as part of a hackathon through the Equitable Data Science for Adolescent Development REU at the University of Minnesota by Shelby Tisdale and Sam Darby.
