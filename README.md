This repository includes all code for a brief project in which propensity score matching was utilized to determine the causal impact of high physical activity on mortality. All data is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), "a large, ongoing, cross-sectional study of the non-institutionalized US population conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in two-year waves using a multi-stage stratified sampling scheme."
